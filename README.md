microcontroller-projects
========================

A home for my microcontroller projects, including Stubby the Hexapod and others.  It includes libraries for avr-gcc along with sample programs on how to use them, some KiCad modules, and the source code for a number of projects.

Some projects include:
-Stubby the Hexapod (http://stubby.digitalcave.ca/stubby/)
-DrumMaster (http://drummaster.digitalcave.ca/drummaster/)

Some of the AVR libraries included here are:
-serial communications
-TWI (I2C), with support for master read / master write / slave read / slave write, plus callback functions for asyncronous communications
-reading data from a PS2 controller
-timer functions
-and much more
