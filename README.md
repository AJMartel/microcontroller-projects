microcontroller-projects
========================

A home for my microcontroller projects, including Stubby the Hexapod and others.  It includes libraries for avr-gcc along with sample programs on how to use them, some KiCad modules, and the source code for a number of projects.

Some major projects include:
 * Stubby the Hexapod (http://stubby.digitalcave.ca/stubby/) (Now extracted into its own repo at https://github.com/thebiguno/stubby)
 * DrumMaster (http://drummaster.digitalcave.ca/drummaster/)
 * Chiindii (http://chiindii.digitalcave.ca/chiindii/)

Some of the AVR libraries included here are:
 * serial communications
 * TWI (I2C), with support for master read / master write / slave read / slave write, plus callback functions for asyncronous communications
 * reading data from a PS2 controller
 * timer functions
 * and much more
