Breadboard Breakouts

A collection of useful breakouts useful for protyping on standard breadboards.

Pin Header - 10 x 2 pin header breakout

LED Bar - 10 LED bar graph with current limiting resistors for 5V prototyping, and female pin headers for bypadding the current limitng resistors for custom values. Useful for indication.

DIP Switch - TODO

Pushbutton - TODO
