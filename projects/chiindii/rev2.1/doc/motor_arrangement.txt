The Chiindii-8 motors are arranged as follows:

    2
  1   6
 5     7
  8   3
    4

The motor spin directions are as follows:
Motors 2, 7, 4, 5: CW
Motors 1, 6, 3, 8: CCW

When using the Hubsan motors, the CW motors are the ones with Red (+) and Blue (-), while
the CCW motors are the ones with White (+) and Black (-).

The A props go on the CW (Red / Blue) motors, and the B props go on the CCW (White / Black) motors.

roll is rotating about the x axis
pitch is rotating about the y axis

Gyro measurements follow the direction of the arrow on the MPU.  Specifically:
For the X axis, rolling to the right is positive and rolling to the left is negative.
For the Y axis, pitching the front of the craft down is positive, pitching up is negative.
For the Z axis, looking down at the craft from above, yaw clockwise is negative, counter clockwise is positive.


LED conditions
blue	no comms
red		low battery
green	unarmed (safe to pick up)
white	armed and with to other error condition (running strobe)

the timing of the LED conditions is as follows

{signal: [
  {name: 'errors', wave: 'x3450x', data: ['comm', 'batt', 'safe'] },
  {name: 'strobe', wave: 'x0..1x' },
  {name: 'time',   wave: 'x====x', data: ['.25s', '.25s', '.25s', '.25'] }
