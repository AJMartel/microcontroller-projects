The Chiindii motors are arranged clockwise in ascending numeric order, starting at the
front left of the craft.

The motor spin directions are as follows:
Motor 1 and 3: CW
Motor 2 and 4: CCW

When using the Hubsan motors, the CW motors are the ones with Red (+) and Blue (-), while
the CCW motors are the ones with White (+) and Black (-).

The A props go on the CW (Red / Blue) motors, and the B props go on the CCW (White / Black) motors.
