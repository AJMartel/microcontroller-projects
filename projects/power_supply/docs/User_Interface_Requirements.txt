-Built-in GUI
	-Interface uses 20x4 char HD44780 display + 2x encoders with push buttons
	-Each line on the display is one channel:
		 12345678901234567890
		1 +12.04V +5.000A
		2  +3.31V -0.020A
		3  +1.80V +0.000A
		4  +5.00V +2.357A

	-In normal (state == locked) operation, the display will show the actual measurements for voltage / current
	-To get into 'set' mode (state == unlocked), push and hold encoder 1 for 2+ seconds (from normal mode)
		-In set mode, a cursor will appear beside an item in a channel:
			 12345678901234567890
			1#+12.04V +5.000A
			2  +3.31V -0.020A
			3  +1.80V +0.000A
			4  +5.00V +2.357A
		-The cursor will show the channel / item which is to be modified
		-Encoder 1 modifies the integer portion (1)
		-Encoder 2 modifies in increments of 2 decimal places (0.01)
		-Press encoder 1 to switch between items in a L->R, T->B configuration
			-E.g. Initially channel 1 voltage will be selected.  Press encoder 1 to switch to channel 1 current.  Press again to switch to channel 2 voltage, then channel 2 amperage, etc.
		-Press encoder 2 to navigate backwards (opposite direction of channel 1)
		-Settings immediately take effect
		-To lock the settings and go back to measurement / normal mode, press and hold encoder 1 for 2+ seconds.  The cursor will disappear.
	-To get into 'menu' mode, press and hold encoder 2 for 2+ seconds (from the normal mode)
		-In menu mode, you see different options, with a cursor beside the selected one:
			 12345678901234567890
			1#Menu option 1
			2 Menu option 2
			3 Menu option 3
			4 Menu option 4
		-Turn encoder 1 to navigate
		-Tap encoder 1 to enter / modify / perform a menu item (exact meaning depends on menu semantics)
		-Once in a menu item, turn encoder 2 to change values (optional, depending on menu semantics)
		-Tap encoder 2 to apply menu item (enter)
		-Tap encoder 1 to exit menu item (cancel / esc)
		-Some menu options include:
			-Save current values as default (power on default)
			-Save current values to (named?) bank
			-Load current values from bank
			-??????
-USB Operation
	-If a USB cable is plugged in, the program automatically enumerates as a raw HID device
	-Measured values are logged on a repeating basis (1Hz?  10Hz?  What is a reasonable frequency here?  Make it configurable?)
	-Set values can be sent from program
	-Python program used for logging + setting values
	-All menu operations should be supported from USB, allowing for complete computer operation with no external UI.
