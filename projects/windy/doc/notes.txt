amps: 0A to 40A +/- 1A
volts: 0V to 30V +/- 0.5V (presets for 6V, 12V, 24V batteries?; voltage divider for 24V batteries?)
frequency: 0Hz to 15Hz +/- 0.5Hz
frequency: 0rpm to 900rpm +/- 10rpm

60 rpm = 1 Hz
300 rpm = 5 Hz
600 rpm = 10 Hz
900 rpm = 15 Hz
1200 rpm = 20 Hz

T0 SQW 60 times per minute
	TCNT0 reset to 0 when COMP0A = 60
T1 TACH 0 to 900 times per minute
	TCNT1 reset to 0 when COMP0A = 60
	Hz = TCNT1 / TCNT0
	
Relay pin PB0 is an input to detect when system is in service mode.
When automatic shutdown is required, PB0 becomes and output and is set high to engage the relay.

cut in of 1Hz = 100 windings/coil
