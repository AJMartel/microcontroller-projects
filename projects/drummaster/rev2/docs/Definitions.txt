Definitions and Terminology:

Pad: A single logical instrument in a drum set, which maps to one or more analog signals 
	and zero or more digital signals.  This is the abstract class; sub classes include 
	Drum, Cymbal, and HiHat.
Drum: An instance of a pad which only responds to a single analog signal
Cymbal: An instance of a pad which responds to a single analog signal and a single digital
	signal (for 'mute' or 'choke').
HiHat: An instance of a pad which responds to two analog signals (velocity and pedal position)
	and a single digital signal (pedal 'tight')
Signal: An analog or digital input, via the multiplexers.
Channel: A single playback channel, containing a AudioPlaySerialRaw object.  There is a set 
	maximum number of channels which can co-exist on the system before playback is compromised;
	currently this maximum is about 12.
Sample: A raw digital audio file, encoded in 16 bit PCM raw format.  One sample can be played
	back in a Channel at any given time.
