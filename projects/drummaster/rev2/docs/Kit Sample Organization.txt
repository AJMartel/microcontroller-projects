Each kit is located in the root of the SD card.  All samples within a kit are in the same subfolder of root.

The naming convension for samples is as follows:

XX_V_N.raw

where:
	XX is the two letter drum name, as follows:
		SN = Snare
		BS = Bass
		T1 = Tom 1 (High)
		T2 = Tom 2 (Med)
		T3 = Tom 3 (Low)
		DX = Drum X (Extra drum)
		CR = Crash
		SP = Splash
		RD = Ride
		CX = Cymbal X (Extra cymbal)
		H1 = HiHat Fully Closed
		H2 = HiHat Semi Closed
		H3 = HiHat Half Open
		H4 = HiHat Semi Open
		H5 = HiHat Fully Open
		HC = HiHat Chic
		HS = Hihat Foot Splash
	V is the relative velocity (from 0-9, 0 being lowest velocity and 9 being highest)
	N is the sample number, allowing multiple samples for the same drum + velocity (from a-z); if there are multiple samples, one will be randomly selected.
	
All samples MUST be in mono signed 16 bit PCM RAW format.
