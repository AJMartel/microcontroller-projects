Each kit is located in the root of the SD card.  All samples within a kit are in the same subfolder of root.

The naming convension for samples is as follows:

XX_V_N.RAW

where:
	XX is the two letter drum name, as follows:
		SN = Snare
		BS = Bass
		T1 = Tom 1 (High)
		T2 = Tom 2 (Med)
		T3 = Tom 3 (Low)
		CR = Crash
		SP = Splash
		RD = Ride
		H1 = HiHat Fully Closed
		H2 = HiHat Semi Closed
		H3 = HiHat Half Open
		H4 = HiHat Semi Open
		H5 = HiHat Fully Open
		HC = HiHat Chic
		HS = Hihat Foot Splash
		X0 = Extra pad 0
		X1 = Extra pad 1
	V is the relative velocity (hex digit from 0-F, 0 being lowest velocity and F being highest).  These 
		do not need to be continuous; for instance, you can have one sample at volume 0 and another at 
		volume F, and the software will choose the closest one.
	N is the sample number, allowing multiple samples for the same drum + velocity (hex digit from 0-F); if
		there are multiple samples, one will be randomly selected.  This is zero based, and need to be 
		continuous; for instance, if you have a sample number 3 you must also have 2, 1, and 0.  If there 
		is only one sample, it must have sample number 0.
	
All samples MUST be in mono signed 16 bit PCM RAW format, and all filenames MUST be in all capital letters.
