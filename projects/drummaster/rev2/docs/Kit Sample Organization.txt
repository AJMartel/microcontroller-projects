Each kit is located in the root of the SD card.  All samples within a kit are in the same subfolder of root.

The naming convension for samples is as follows:

XX_V_N.raw

where:
	XX is the two letter drum name (e.g. SN for snare, RD for ride, etc)
	V is the relative velocity (from 0-9, 0 being lowest velocity and 9 being highest)
	N is the sample number, allowing multiple samples for the same drum + velocity (from a-z); if there are multiple samples, one will be randomly selected.
	
The exception to this is the HiHat.  Here, the sample naming is as follows:

HH_XX_V_N.raw

where:
	HH is always HH (HiHat samples)
	XX is the type of hit, and is one of:
		FC - Fully Closed
		SC - Semi Closed
		HO - Half Open
		SO - Semi Open
		FO - Fully Open
		SP - Foot Splash
		CK - Foot Chic
	V and N are the same as above.

All samples MUST be in mono signed 16 bit PCM RAW format.
