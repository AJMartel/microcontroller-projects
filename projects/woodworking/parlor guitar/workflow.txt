Install ede graft wedge
	Cut a slot (tapered)
	Glue end graft in place, optionally with purfling
Binding / Purfling on body
	Cut rabbets in body top / back with router
		Create a sort of sled for the body; some sort of shims to account for radiused top / bottom and keep everything flat.  Cork strips?
		If purfling is to be used, use 3/16" groove, followed by deeper 1/8" groove.
		If only binding is to be used, use 1/8" groove.
		To miter the purfling on the end wedge, don't cut all the way to the wedge, then clean up with a chisel.  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6haG-aDM-eg at about 7:30 for instructions.
	Use a sizing mixture of 2:1 water:hide glue (or thin, super blonde shellac) to seal wood around channel and binding strips
	Dry fit, with mitered purfling, starting at tail, making sure that the binding is exactly square
	Use thin CA glue to glue binding in place
	Thoroughly sand to remove any surface glue
Rough neck assembly

	Cut tenon
	Add to sides of headstock
